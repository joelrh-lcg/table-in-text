# table-in-text

## Description
Script for identifying tables in plain text documents and saves them in an output file that ony contains the tables.
The model was trained using SVM classifier on a dataset of 150 articles containing 410 tables and 45406 non-table sentences.


## Requirements
Works over pre-processed Stanford CoreNLP documents  

The inputs files of this code are generated by Stanford Core NLP, for details of installation visit: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/index.html
Once the program is installed, run the following comands inside table-in-text directory: 
'''
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/stanford-corenlp-4.2.0/*:
'''
'''
for file in - path/files/to_tokenize/ 
do
java -mx3g edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLP -annotators tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma -outputFormat json -outputDirectory NLP/TestJsonNLP_Files/ -file "${file}" ;
done                            
'''
